     * Returns 0 if there exist no multiplicative inverse

     *  positive modular multiplicative inverse for the number.
     *
     * Let a = number, n = mod. ax â‰¡ 1 (mod n) is equivalent
     *  to ax - qn = 1 for some integers x and q.
     *
     * Fact: If abs(GCD(number, mod)) != 1, there exists no inverse.
     *  Proof:
     *   let g = GCD(a, n), a = gA, n = gN where A = a/g, N = n/g.
     *   ax - qn = 1 is equivalent to gAx - gqN = 1 = g(Ax - qN).
     *   This implies that g must divide 1, and the only integers
     *   that divide 1 are 1 and -1.
     *
     * We're looking for a solution for the equation "ax - qn = 1"
     *  which can be written as "ax - qn = GCD(a, n)". Notice that
     *  the extended Euclidean algorithm is perfect here.
     *
     * In modular arithmetic, you can't just divide by a number.
     *  If you want to divide by a number x, you have to multiply
     *  by the modular multiplicative inverse of x. This is because
     *  not every number has an inverse, thus, you might be dividing
     *  by a number that has no inverse. BUT, if you know that x has
     *  an inverse under the mod, you can divide by x.
     * Remember that a number x has an inverse if GCD(x, mod) = 1. This
     *  means that if mod is a prime number, then you can divide by any
     *  number less than the mod.
     * Take a look at https://qr.ae/pvHGez.
